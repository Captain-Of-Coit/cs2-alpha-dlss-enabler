# Cities: Skylines 2 - Alpha DLSS Enabler

This mods enables the experimental DLSS support. WARNING! When I say experimental, I mean it. Bunch of graphical artifacts are introduced when you activate this mod, as it's not properly implemented yet.

Personally I experienced ~10 FPS on average increase. However, performance when viewing citizens is still abysmall and this doesn't seem to help a lot with that particular problem.

The benchmark was made by animating the camera from outside the city to zoomed in one a meeting point of two metro stations with lots of pedestrians.
